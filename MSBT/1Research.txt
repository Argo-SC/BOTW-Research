Text Delay Timer (Text_Delay_EUen.PNG)
	String 00 00 00 XX Most likely applies to the timer.
	XX = speed of text.
	offset 0xE9 and 0x1007
	37 = ~1.85sec
	4B = ~2.53sec
	every 30 decimal turned into hex adds a 1 second delay or 30 frame delay. (Delay_Test.txt)
		JPN version does not delay text and these 4 bits are not present (No_Text_Delay_EUvsJPN.PNG)
		This does NOT work cutscenes that do not already possess this code.

Toggle Red Highlight Color (Highlight_Red_EUen.PNG)
	After the string 00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 XX XX
	XX = FF OFF
	XX = 00 ON
		Same aplies in the JPN version
		
Toggle Blue Highlight Color (Hightlight_Blue_EUen.PNG)
	Similar to the Red Highlight, 00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 XX YY
	XX & FF = FF OFF
	XX = 02 ON
	YY = 00 ON
	
Color Choices (Colour_Test.txt)
	Based on the info above, 00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 XX YY refrences color
	YY is most likely a part of color since 00 is required to view color (defaults to red if different)
	XX is the color the text will be. 
	00 = Red
	01 = Green
	02 = Blue
	05 = Orange
	03 = Gray
		These are all the combinations that I found through my trails. There might be more colors however
		I believe that they are reference codes to color rather than the color itself

	XX & YY = FF the color is ended (00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 FF FF)
		Both have to be FF otherwise the color does not change from the start
