Sheikah Slate Color

00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 00 00 = Red		In Demo700_0.msbt
00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 02 00 = Blue		In Demo701_0.msbt
00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 FF FF = White	In Both documents


00 0E 00 00 00 03 00 02 00 XX 00 = Variable Color

By using the Demo700_0.msbt I will change the XX Value that appears to select the color
By changing the XX to different values, the item "Sheikah Stone" text should change color
in the sentence "That is a Sheikah Stone."

First trial is changing text to blue as seen in Demo701_0.msbt
The proceeding trails are testing different combinations to see color changes

Trial 1:	02 = Light Blue (Same blue in Demo701_0.msbt)
Trial 2:	01 = Green
Trail 3:	03 = Grey
Trail 4:	04 = Blue
Trail 5:	05 = Orange
Trail 6:	06 = Grey
Trail 7:	07 = Red
Trial 8:	0A = Red
Trail 9:	08 = Red

The XX does change the color however I am unable to find colors beyond these
